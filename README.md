This repository demonstrates a common error in F# related to the use of mutable variables. The `bug.fs` file contains code that uses mutable variables in a function. This leads to unexpected behavior if the mutable variables are modified after the function is called.  The `bugSolution.fs` file provides a solution that avoids mutable variables, resulting in more predictable and maintainable code.
